### Intro

Sinuous provides the clarity of declarative views and the performance of direct DOM manipulation.  
It was built with these ideas in mind.

- Small: use in other mini libraries like custom elements.
- Simple: plain Javascript feel; template literals, standard HTML.
- [Performance](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html): top ranked of 80+ UI libs

### Concept

Sinuous started as a little experiment to get similar behavior as [Surplus](https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus) but with template literals instead of JSX.
[HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) compiles to an `h` tag. Adapted code from [Ryan Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/babel-plugin-jsx-dom-expressions)'s dom expressions + a Reactive library provides the reactivity.

Sinuous returns a [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) function which is armed to handle the callback functions from the reactive library and updates the DOM accordingly.

### Counter Example (_1.4kB gzip_) ([Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/sinuous-counter-z6k71))

```js
import { o, html } from 'sinuous';

const counter = o(0);
const view = () => {
  return html`
    <div>Counter ${counter}</div>
  `;
};

document.body.append(view());
setInterval(() => counter(counter() + 1), 1000);
```

### Browser Support

Sinuous supports modern browsers and IE11+:

### Use your own reactive library

Sinuous can work with different observable libraries. See the [wiki for more info](https://github.com/luwes/sinuous/wiki/Choose-your-own-reactive-library).
