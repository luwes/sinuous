Sinuous provides a submodule called [`map`](https://github.com/luwes/sinuous/tree/main/packages/sinuous/map) to make rendering large lists as snappy as possible.

## Without `map`

It is possible to create lists without this module but the drawback is that it would re-render each element in the list every time an item gets added or removed. Lets take a a look at that first.

```js
import { o, html } from 'sinuous';

const list = o([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const view = () => html`
  <ul>
    ${() =>
      list().map(
        i =>
          html`
            <li>${i}: ${Date.now()}</li>
          `
      )}
  </ul>
`;
```

Rendering a list without the `map` module can still be useful if the number of items is fairly small and it's technically not an issue all elements get re-rendered or if the list has a static number of items but the content in each item is dynamic.

```js
import { o, html } from 'sinuous';

const list = [{ name: o('John') }, { name: o('Lisa') }, { name: o('Pete') }];
const view = () => html`
  <ul>
    ${list.map(
      obj =>
        html`
          <li>${obj.name}</li>
        `
    )}
  </ul>
`;

document.body.append(view());

// Change observable value of the 3rd item in the list.
list[2].name('Jack');
```

## With `map`

In a lot of cases you'll find yourself with a list that'll change in the number of items and then it's recommended to use the provided `map` module.

This module will make a diff of the new state with the old state and make the least amount of DOM operations to create the new view.

```js
import { o, html } from 'sinuous';
import { map } from 'sinuous/map';

const list = o([
  { id: 1, text: o('bread') },
  { id: 2, text: o('milk') },
  { id: 3, text: o('honey') },
  { id: 4, text: o('chips') },
  { id: 5, text: o('cookie') }
]);
const view = () => html`
  <ul>
    ${map(
      list,
      item =>
        html`
          <li id=${item.id}>${item.text}</li>
        `
    )}
  </ul>
`;

document.body.append(view());

setInterval(() => {
  list([...list().sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)]);
}, 1000);
```

If you look closer in the web inspector you'll notice that most of the time not all the item elements will light up signifying a DOM operation. This is the diff engine at work and will keep your list rendering super snappy!
